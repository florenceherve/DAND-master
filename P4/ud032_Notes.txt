DATASET:
The dataset was downloaded from Mapzen: https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/metro/perth_australia/

This is a metro extract of Perth, WA, Australia. Size of 254MB with the remaining sample file to be ~50MB.

I've chosen Perth as I have been living there briefly when I was a student, and have some fond memories of it.
